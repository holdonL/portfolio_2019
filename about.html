                <p>Hello, visitors! My name is Pasha. 
                    I'm an aspiring web developer. I've been learning HTML5 and CSS3 for a few months, as well as building some test 
                    mockups that you can check on this website. Moreover, I've started to use SASS and Grid layout a little. 
                    Also I am familiar with Git and I have lately become passionate about JavaScript. 
                    As for image editor I prefer Adobe Photoshop and Zeplin, especially the second one.
                    My goal is to become a professional Front-end developer. I'm accustomed to self-studying and I'm a quick learner.
                    I get along well with people. You're welcome to have a look at my projects.
                </p>

                <h3>Education</h3>
                <p>I was born in Volgograd. From 1999 up to 2010 I 
                    studied at Gymnasium 14 with profound learning of foreign languages.
                    From 2010 up to 2014 I studied English and Spanish 
                    at the Institute of Foreign Languages, a department of Volgograd State Social Pedagogical University, and graduated from it
                    with a Bachelor degree.
                    Since my early age I've been interested in computers, hardware and software.

                <h3>Working experience</h3>
                <p>I've been living in Saint-Petersburg for a few years now and I worked in several
                    mobile repairing centers as a manager. I worked with customers, documents and was in charge for spare parts supply.
                    I had 2-5 people in submission.
                    I was responsible for initial finding faults with gadgets and setting up
                    with customers the prices and timing. It was okay with me but I wanted more. And 
                    at some point I decided that becoming a developer would be a real challenge.
